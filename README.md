# Lane-Segmmentation-using-Deep-Learning

# Problem:
Lane detection is a crucial task in autonomous driving systems, as it enables the vehicle to
navigate through roads without colliding with obstacles. Accurate lane segmentation helps in
identifying the position and shape of the lanes on the road, enabling the vehicle to stay in its lane
and make safe driving decisions. However, the task of lane segmentation is challenging due to
varying lighting conditions, occlusions, and road markings that can be obscured or faded.

# Approach:
In this project, I will be implementing a deep learning-based approach for lane segmentation.
The algorithm uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify each pixel in the image as
either belonging to a lane or not. The network is trained using a dataset of annotated road
images, enabling it to learn robust representations of lane markings.

# Data:
We will be using the Lane Detection for Carla Driving Simulator dataset, which is available on
Kaggle. The dataset consists of images captured from a simulated driving environment, where
the vehicle is equipped with cameras mounted on its roof. The dataset includes a total of 6,408
labeled images.

# Conclusion:
The proposed project aims to develop a robust lane detection system using deep learning
techniques, which can accurately identify and segment lanes under varying lighting and road
conditions, and evaluate the performance of the model.
